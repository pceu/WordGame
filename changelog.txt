	- BUT: please also say WHO did each task (at the end of the line, add [NAME]), so I can match it with attendance.php and assign correct grade allocations at end of trimester.

================================== WEEK 5==================================================================================
## Week 5, Wednesday 3/April [Henry]
- Try not to hard-code variables even now. Work with files on disk as one of the first things you do.
	- (YES, we do have a plan for storing user data and will be studying and use one of the storing methods in android.
	   
- Include multi-line comments (/* */) before each function, to outline what the function does, any arguments and return types, and how to use it.
	- (We wil sure do this and thanks for reminding).

Important Note
	- This week, we were super busy with other assignments and could not give much time on this project as there are a other assignments due in
	  on this week as well. We are slightly falling behind than our plan; but we will be give more time next week catching up with the works.
	  Appologies for this week progress as we could not give the time as we wanted.

Monday 1/April
	- watch and research some online resources to create buttons and others such as question board. [Ceu]
	- create button images and question board using photoshop. [Ceu]
Saturday 6/April
	- create a layout for level 2 and add buttons, textViews and others necessary for the level. [Ceu]
	- create buttons, question board and others needed for level 1 page. [Nam]
Sunday 7/April
	- write codes on level 2 class to iterate the Level object and adds them on the screen & modify the level 2 layout. [Ceu]
	- create more buttons and linearlayouts for level 2 page. [Ceu]
	- continue work on level 1 page including fixing issue with Ceu's work. [Nam]

Note:   We have similiar xml file to some extent as I (Ceu) have changed and messed up with the drawable (image). Android Studio did not like the name we gave to the images
	as the names do not keep the naming convention the android studio suggests. As a result, when Nam did the 'Pull' and try to push his work
	on GitHub, errors stopped Nam to proceed with pushing his work. Therefore, Nam figured out and fixed the issue by combining his xml file with Ceu's work
	on level 2.



================================== WEEK 6 ==================================================================================
# Monday 8/April [Henry]

# Thursday 11/April [Henry]
- Good to see code comments improve.
- This file MUST BE UPDATED every day (every work session), per person, to tell the other person what was changed. Otherwise we don't have a summary (me or your teammate) of what you changed.
